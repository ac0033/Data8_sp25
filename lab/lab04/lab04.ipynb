This form is **mandatory** - please fill it out before submitting your lab. Set `submitted` to `True` once you've submitted the form.\n",

You can use this [edThread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/73504/discussion/6120095) to find a partner if you want one. If you wish to work alone, no further action is required. Please set `submitted` to `True` to get credit for this problem.\n",
